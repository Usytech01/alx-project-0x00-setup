📝 Project Assessment (Hybrid)
Your project will be evaluated primarily through manual reviews. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

✅ Complete your project on time
📄 Submit all required files
🔗 Generate your review link
👥 Have your peers review your work

An auto-check will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.

⏰ Important Note
If the deadline passes, you won’t be able to generate your review link—so be sure to submit on time!

We’re here to support your learning journey. Happy coding! ✨
